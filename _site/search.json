    "text": ".\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Word on Sample Size for Sensitivity and Specificity Studies\nWhen planning a study to evaluate the accuracy of a diagnostic test, it is crucial to include enough subjects in both the diseased and non-diseased groups. Two key performance measures are sensitivity (the test’s ability to correctly identify those with the disease) and specificity (the test’s ability to correctly identify those without the disease).\nTo estimate either sensitivity or specificity with a desired level of precision, you can use the standard formula for proportions:\n\\[\nn=z^2×p(1−p)d^2\n\\]\n\\[\nn = \\frac{z^2 \\times p(1-p)}{d^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nn=d^2z^2×p(1−p)​\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(n\\) is the required sample size within the subgroup (diseased or non-diseased),\n\\(z\\) is the critical value corresponding to your desired confidence level (for a 95% confidence interval, \\(z≈1.96z\\))\n\\(p\\) is the expected sensitivity (or specificity), and\n\\(d\\) is the desired margin of error (half-width of the confidence interval).\n\nPractical Example:\nSuppose you expect your diagnostic test to have a sensitivity of 90% (0.90) and you desire a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of ±5% (0.05). The required number of diseased subjects is:\n\\[\nn_{\\text{disease}} =(1.96)^2×0.90(1−0.90)(0.05)^2≈139\n\\] \\[\nn_{\\text{disease}} = \\frac{(1.96)^2 \\times 0.90(1-0.90)}{(0.05)^2} \\approx 139\n\\] \\[\nn_{\\text{disease}} =(0.05)^2(1.96)^2×0.90(1−0.90)​≈139\n\\]\nSimilarly, if you expect a specificity of 90%, you would also need approximately 139 non-diseased subjects to achieve the same precision.\nIf the prevalence of the disease in your study population is known, you can determine the overall total sample size required. For example, if the disease prevalence is 10% (0.10), then to obtain about 139 diseased subjects you would need approximately:\nTotal sample size (for disease)=1390.10≈1390 = 1390Total sample size (for disease)=0.10139​≈1390\nLikewise, you can calculate the total number needed to yield the required number of non-diseased subjects.\n\nReference:\nBuderer, N. M. F. (1996). Statistical methodology: I. Incorporating the prevalence of disease into the sample size calculation for sensitivity and specificity. Academic Emergency Medicine, 3(9), 895-900.\n\n\n\nInteractive Example\nBelow is an interactive Shiny tool pre‐set to the example above. The default inputs assume:\n\nAn expected sensitivity and specificity of 90%\nA desired margin of error of 5%\nA 95% confidence level (with z≈1.96z 1.96z≈1.96)\nA disease prevalence of 10%\n\nUsers can adjust these parameters to match the specifics of their own diagnostic study.\n#| '!!

If you have found our services and you are busy writing your protocol, it is good to touch base and we can advise on what kind of analyses can and cannot answer your research question and ensure your aims and objectives have their statistical partner.\n\n\nSample Size Calculations\nCollaboratively determining sample sizes is a crucial step in your research journey. Our team works with Principal Investigators to refine sample size calculations, incorporating prior work from literature reviews and ensuring statistical validity. Large analyses of secondary dataset may not require a formal sample size calculation but reporting some known sample size of the dataset is favourable.\n\n\nData Wrangling\nData Wrangling—the art of refining and organizing raw data to ensure it’s in optimal shape for analysis. We conduct simple variable recoding up to more complex dataset merging or probablisitc record linkage studies. Useful solutions also inlude natural language text processing, which involved transforming high-volume free-text responses into structured and analyzable data.\n\n\nStatistical Analysis\nOur expertise covers a spectrum of statistical analyses, including descriptive statistics (mean, median), basic comparisons (chi-squared, Fischer’s exact, Wilcoxon, etc.), regression models, survival analysis, and Cox proportional and extended hazard models for longitudinal cohort studies and clinical trials.\n\n\nCost-Effectiveness and QALY Calculations\nWe can assist in navigating the complexities of cost-effectiveness and Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) calculations however this is not an area of expertise.\n\n\nPublication-Ready Tables\nTransforming your data into compelling and publication-ready tables is a critical step in presenting your findings. We have a strong focus on ensuring that your tables are formatted, clean and logical. We also ensure that tables formatting align with the standards of your target journal.\n\n\nFigures\nWe offer extended consulting for the creation of specific figures, including bar graphs, line graphs, and Likert scale graphs when the figure are more efficient than tables.\n\n\nAssistance and Consulting\nBeyond data analysis, we provide comprehensive assistance and consulting on result interpretation and discussion writing. Although it is often overlooked, we take pride in understanding the exact metric we report on and know what you can and cannot say about your data. Our goal is to ensure that the statistical aspects of your research are presented with clarity and depth.\n\n\nReal-time trial monitoring\nWhile this has been set up in theory, it has not yet been done practically for a client. For those wishing to follow the results of their project in near real-time and are collecting data with an active API we may create simple tables and analsyes that run and indicate when your sample size has reached saturation. This may be useful if there is uncertainty in your sample size calculation or if resources per participant is expensive."

See our blog article on how to develop a research question for more information.\nYour research question and objectives are closely aligned to your analysis plan and data you have availbale, and so it is a good idea to keep all those components in mind, We have some tools to assist you with calculating basic sample sizes and this can help you see whether your research question is feasible with the data you have available or the data you may have to collect.\nOnce you have a protocol finalised, which includes a sample size calcualtion and ethical approval we can provide you with a quote for completing the project. We begin work with a 50% deposit and the remainder can be paid wonce the project has been reasonabl finished, this can be when you submit it for marking or submit it to a journal.\nIt is best to send us a copy of your rough protocol and let us know how far along you are with, ethics and or data collection.\nOnce we receive data we try provide a rough preliminary analysis within 1-2 weeks. This gets sent as an .html file as some tables can be large and poorly formatted. We usually receiev some first impressions and simple feedback on the overall analysis and then revise it to a second draft. There may be some smaller updates here and then we publis it to a word document. We may get more revisions here, such as labelling, captions etc.\nThe ifnal product can be a table that you can copy paste into your manuscript.\nWe are not experts in copy editing and we reocmend a service like Proof Reading Pal for this. We can however, assist you in some interpretation of your tables and certain writing idiosyncracies. We have written a blog on some do’s and don’ts. IN addition, this journal article is a great summary on academic wriitng and statistics interpretation in the health sciences."

In this context, you first need an estimate of the outcome’s prevalence in your study population.\nFor example, imagine you plan to study factors associated with HIV acquisition among substance abusers. Suppose that based on prior studies you estimate the prevalence of HIV infection in this group to be about 10%—that is, 10% of substance abusers are HIV positive.\nNow, assume you want to examine five predictors:\n\nNumber of sexual partners\nIntravenous drug use\nAge\nSex\nEducational status (e.g., whether the individual has completed matriculation)\n\nA common rule-of-thumb (Peduzzi et al., 1996) is that there should be at least 10 outcomes (events) per predictor. This “10 Events Per Predictor (EPV)” guideline is used to help ensure that your logistic regression model is stable, less than 10 events per predictor may result in biased estimates in alternating directions.\nThe sample size calculation is based on the formula:\n\\[\nn=EPV×kp\n\\] \\[\nn = \\frac{\\text{EPV} \\times k}{p}\n\\] \\[\nn=pEPV×k​\n\\] Where:\n\n\\(n\\) = Total required sample size\n\\(EPV\\)= 10 (the recommended minimum number of events per predictor)\n\\(k\\) = Number of predictors (here, 5)\n\\(p\\) = Outcome prevalence (here, 0.10 which is a prevalnece of 10% ie. if 10 people in your sample of 100 people have HIV, the prevalence of HIV in your sample is 10%)\n\nPlugging in these values:\n\\[\nn=10×50.10=50\n\\] \\[\nn = \\frac{10 \\times 5}{0.10} = 500\n\\] \\[\nn=0.1010×5​=500\n\\]\nThis calculation suggests you would need approximately 500 participants to expect around 50 HIV-positive cases—meeting the 10 events per predictor guideline.\n\nReference:\nPeduzzi, P., Concato, J., Kemper, E., Holford, T.R., & Feinstein, A.R. (1996). A simulation study of the number of events per variable in logistic regression analysis.

Data that follows a normal distribution has different characteristics compared to data that is non-normal. In many cases, transformations such as the log or square root can help meet the assumptions of statistical tests and improve data interpretation.\nIn this post, we’ll explore: - Normal distributions and their properties - Non-normal distributions and why they matter - How log and square root transformations can help\n\n\n\nNormal Distributions\nA normal distribution, often called a Gaussian distribution, is symmetric around its mean. Its bell-shaped curve is defined by the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ). Many statistical methods assume normality because of its well-understood properties.\nKey features of a normal distribution: - Symmetry about the mean - Mean, median, and mode coincide - Defined by two parameters (mean and standard deviation)\nExample:\nMany biological measurements (like blood pressure in a healthy population) are assumed to follow a normal distribution.\n\n\n\nNon-Normal Distributions\nNot all data in biostatistics follow a normal distribution. Skewed data, for example, may be right-skewed or left-skewed. Non-normal data can occur due to natural biological variability or due to the measurement process itself.\nCommon examples include: - Right-skewed data: Enzyme levels, income data, or time-to-event data\n- Left-skewed data: Certain bounded measurements where many values cluster near an upper limit\nWhen data are non-normal, the usual statistical tests that assume normality might not be valid, which is why transformations are often applied.\n\n\n\nLog Transformation\nA log transformation is frequently used when data are right-skewed. By taking the logarithm of the data, extreme values are compressed, which often results in a distribution that is closer to normal.\nBenefits: - Stabilizes the variance - Makes the data more symmetric - Facilitates the use of parametric statistical tests\nWhen to use:\nIf your data ranges over several orders of magnitude (e.g., hormone concentrations or viral load), a log transformation can be very effective.\nExample code in R:\n\n# Original data vector \ndata &lt;- c(1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000) \n# Log-transformed data \nlog_data &lt;- log(data) \n\nprint(log_data)"
