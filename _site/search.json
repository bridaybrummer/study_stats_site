    "text": "Activities\n\nProtocol and Thesis Methodology Writing\nA protocol is your road map. It is your backup when things become confusing later down the line. If you have found our services and you are busy writing your protocol, it is good to touch base and we can advise on what kind of analyses can and cannot answer your research question and ensure your aims and objectives have their statistical partner.\n\n\nSample Size Calculations\nCollaboratively determining sample sizes is a crucial step in your research journey. Our team works with Principal Investigators to refine sample size calculations, incorporating prior work from literature reviews and ensuring statistical validity. Large analyses of secondary dataset may not require a formal sample size calculation but reporting some known sample size of the dataset is favourable.\n\n\nData Wrangling\nData Wrangling—the art of refining and organizing raw data to ensure it’s in optimal shape for analysis. We conduct simple variable recoding up to more complex dataset merging or probablisitc record linkage studies. Useful solutions also inlude natural language text processing, which involved transforming high-volume free-text responses into structured and analyzable data.\n\n\nStatistical Analysis\nOur expertise covers a spectrum of statistical analyses, including descriptive statistics (mean, median), basic comparisons (chi-squared, Fischer’s exact, Wilcoxon, etc.), regression models, survival analysis, and Cox proportional and extended hazard models for longitudinal cohort studies and clinical trials.\n\n\nCost-Effectiveness and QALY Calculations\nWe can assist in navigating the complexities of cost-effectiveness and Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) calculations however this is not an area of expertise.\n\n\nPublication-Ready Tables\nTransforming your data into compelling and publication-ready tables is a critical step in presenting your findings. We have a strong focus on ensuring that your tables are formatted, clean and logical. We also ensure that tables formatting align with the standards of your target journal.\n\n\nFigures\nWe offer extended consulting for the creation of specific figures, including bar graphs, line graphs, and Likert scale graphs when the figure are more efficient than tables.\n\n\nAssistance and Consulting\nBeyond data analysis, we provide comprehensive assistance and consulting on result interpretation and discussion writing. Although it is often overlooked, we take pride in understanding the exact metric we report on and know what you can and cannot say about your data. Our goal is to ensure that the statistical aspects of your research are presented with clarity and depth.\n\n\nReal-time trial monitoring\nWhile this has been set up in theory, it has not yet been done practically for a client. For those wishing to follow the results of their project in near real-time and are collecting data with an active API we may create simple tables and analsyes that run and indicate when your sample size has reached saturation. This may be useful if there is uncertainty in your sample size calculation or if resources per participant is expensive."

Data that follows a normal distribution has different characteristics compared to data that is non-normal. In many cases, transformations such as the log or square root can help meet the assumptions of statistical tests and improve data interpretation.\nIn this post, we’ll explore: - Normal distributions and their properties - Non-normal distributions and why they matter - How log and square root transformations can help\n\n\n\nNormal Distributions\nA normal distribution, often called a Gaussian distribution, is symmetric around its mean. Its bell-shaped curve is defined by the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ). Many statistical methods assume normality because of its well-understood properties.\nKey features of a normal distribution: - Symmetry about the mean - Mean, median, and mode coincide - Defined by two parameters (mean and standard deviation)\nExample:\nMany biological measurements (like blood pressure in a healthy population) are assumed to follow a normal distribution.\n\n\n\nNon-Normal Distributions\nNot all data in biostatistics follow a normal distribution. Skewed data, for example, may be right-skewed or left-skewed. Non-normal data can occur due to natural biological variability or due to the measurement process itself.\nCommon examples include: - Right-skewed data: Enzyme levels, income data, or time-to-event data\n- Left-skewed data: Certain bounded measurements where many values cluster near an upper limit\nWhen data are non-normal, the usual statistical tests that assume normality might not be valid, which is why transformations are often applied.\n\n\n\nLog Transformation\nA log transformation is frequently used when data are right-skewed. By taking the logarithm of the data, extreme values are compressed, which often results in a distribution that is closer to normal.\nBenefits: - Stabilizes the variance - Makes the data more symmetric - Facilitates the use of parametric statistical tests\nWhen to use:\nIf your data ranges over several orders of magnitude (e.g., hormone concentrations or viral load), a log transformation can be very effective.\nExample code in R:\n\n# Original data vector \ndata &lt;- c(1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000) \n# Log-transformed data \nlog_data &lt;- log(data) \n\nprint(log_data)"
