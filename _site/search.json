    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThis post is a look at the cost of sports nutrition in South Africa, specifically looking at the cost per gram of carbohydrates. The goal is to provide a quick reference for athletes and cyclists to make informed decisions about their nutrition choices based on cost-effectiveness. While sports nutrition products do offer other things like caffeine, “electrolytes” in various forms, we felt that the cost and grams of carbohydrate are the first things to consider when planning trainig and racing.\n\n\nMethodology\nWe used chatbots to scrape prices from websites and include the website the price was taken from so that each price was then checked. We collected claimed product weight and carbohydrate contents from the nutrition label and the price from the website to calculate the rands per gram. We divided products into four categories: gels, bars, drink mixes, and everyday foods for real-life comparisons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations\nPrices, stock, specials and discount codes may influence prices here. Carbohydrate composition (glucose:fructose ratio), and sodium content of the products are not considered. The carbohydrate content of the products is based on the manufacturer’s claims, and may not be accurate. The actual vs claimed carbohydrate is not measured, nor is the amount of residual product that is left in the product packaging accounted for. We also did not account for the ease of use of the product such gel-opening failure rates, or how long a drink mix may take to dissolve. We also did not measure how long it may take to consume x amount of carbohydrate for each product.\n\n\nConclusion\nAssuming all other things equal, the rand per gram may be a simple was to guide purchasing decisions. Gel products are the most expensive, followed by bars and drink mixes.\n\n\nPractical Applications\nHigh value gel products should not cost more than double the rands for the amount of carbohydrate they contain. For instance, a gel that contains 30g of carbohydrate should not cost more than R60.\nHigh value drink mix products should contain double the amount of carbohydrate per rand spent. For instance, a drink mix tub that contains 800g of carbohydrate should not cost more than R400.\n\n\nNot medical advice but food for thought\nThere is evidence to suggest that oxidation rates of gels, bars and drinks mixes do not differ when matched with liquid consumption (Jeukendrup, 2014; Pfeiffer, Stellingwerff, Zaltas, & Jeukendrup, 2010a, 2010b) and therefore the the product type should be chosen based on personal preference, such as convenience or taste, instead of for “performance” reasons.\n\nPfeiffer, B., Stellingwerff, T., Zaltas, E., & Jeukendrup, A. E. (2010a). CHO Oxidation from a CHO Gel Compared with a Drink during Exercise.

(2017). Fructose and Sucrose Intake Increase Exogenous Carbohydrate Oxidation during Exercise. Nutrients, 9(2), 167. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9020167\nProducts may market natural flavoring or high quality ingredients as reasons that they are better than other products, but there is evidence to suggest that the body does not actually know the difference between food sources marketed as sports food and those that are not (Cramer, Dumke, Hailes, Cuddy, & Ruby, 2015; Flynn, Rosales, Hailes, & Ruby, 2020; Jeukendrup, 2014; Trommelen et al., 2017).\nAnecdotally from this exercise, we noticed that isotonic or high sodium products (like GU Roctane, or “hydrogel” products) are much more expensive than their “normal” counterparts with the main difference being sodium content. Sodium exists in table salt and is cheap to supplement into your drink mixes based on your own needs.\nSince glucose transport is saturated at 60g/hr based on the maximal transport from SGLT1, fructose is the carbohydrate type that can be increased based on increasing needs (intensity or duration) (Jeukendrup, 2014). Fructose is cheap and relatively available at pharmacies or large grocery stores. It can be supplemented into existing drink mixes based on the intensity. The more intense, the more fructose to add. For instance a 90g CHO serving from a product marketed as a 2:1 ratio can have an additional 30g fructose added for a 120g CHO serving without saturating the SGLT1 transporter.\n\nJeukendrup, A. (2014). A Step Towards Personalized Sports Nutrition: Carbohydrate Intake During Exercise.

If you have found our services and you are busy writing your protocol, it is good to touch base and we can advise on what kind of analyses can and cannot answer your research question and ensure your aims and objectives have their statistical partner.\n\n\nSample Size Calculations\nCollaboratively determining sample sizes is a crucial step in your research journey. Our team works with Principal Investigators to refine sample size calculations, incorporating prior work from literature reviews and ensuring statistical validity. Large analyses of secondary dataset may not require a formal sample size calculation but reporting some known sample size of the dataset is favourable.\n\n\nData Wrangling\nData Wrangling—the art of refining and organizing raw data to ensure it’s in optimal shape for analysis. We conduct simple variable recoding up to more complex dataset merging or probablisitc record linkage studies. Useful solutions also inlude natural language text processing, which involved transforming high-volume free-text responses into structured and analyzable data.\n\n\nStatistical Analysis\nOur expertise covers a spectrum of statistical analyses, including descriptive statistics (mean, median), basic comparisons (chi-squared, Fischer’s exact, Wilcoxon, etc.), regression models, survival analysis, and Cox proportional and extended hazard models for longitudinal cohort studies and clinical trials.\n\n\nCost-Effectiveness and QALY Calculations\nWe can assist in navigating the complexities of cost-effectiveness and Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) calculations however this is not an area of expertise.\n\n\nPublication-Ready Tables\nTransforming your data into compelling and publication-ready tables is a critical step in presenting your findings. We have a strong focus on ensuring that your tables are formatted, clean and logical. We also ensure that tables formatting align with the standards of your target journal.\n\n\nFigures\nWe offer extended consulting for the creation of specific figures, including bar graphs, line graphs, and Likert scale graphs when the figure are more efficient than tables.\n\n\nAssistance and Consulting\nBeyond data analysis, we provide comprehensive assistance and consulting on result interpretation and discussion writing. Although it is often overlooked, we take pride in understanding the exact metric we report on and know what you can and cannot say about your data. Our goal is to ensure that the statistical aspects of your research are presented with clarity and depth.\n\n\nReal-time trial monitoring\nWhile this has been set up in theory, it has not yet been done practically for a client. For those wishing to follow the results of their project in near real-time and are collecting data with an active API we may create simple tables and analsyes that run and indicate when your sample size has reached saturation. This may be useful if there is uncertainty in your sample size calculation or if resources per participant is expensive."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A logistic regression has the output of Odds Ratios (OR) and is usually used when the outcome is binary (e.g. yes/no, success/failure). We usually use a logistic regression model to look at the associations between a binary outcome and a set of explanatory variables ( ie. predictors, covariates, independent variables).\nTo inform your sample size for logistic regression, you need some guesswork ideally guided by relevant literature. In this context, you first need an estimate of the outcome’s prevalence in your study population.\nFor example, imagine you plan to study factors associated with HIV acquisition among substance abusers. Suppose that based on prior studies you estimate the prevalence of HIV infection in this group to be about 10%—that is, 10% of substance abusers are HIV positive.\nNow, assume you want to examine five predictors:\n\nNumber of sexual partners\nIntravenous drug use\nAge\nSex\nEducational status (e.g., whether the individual has completed matriculation)\n\nA common rule-of-thumb (Peduzzi et al., 1996) is that there should be at least 10 outcomes (events) per predictor. This “10 Events Per Predictor (EPV)” guideline is used to help ensure that your logistic regression model is stable, less than 10 events per predictor may result in biased estimates in alternating directions.\nThe sample size calculation is based on the formula:\n\\[\nn=EPV×kp\n\\] \\[\nn = \\frac{\\text{EPV} \\times k}{p}\n\\] \\[\nn=pEPV×k​\n\\] Where:\n\n\\(n\\) = Total required sample size\n\\(EPV\\)= 10 (the recommended minimum number of events per predictor)\n\\(k\\) = Number of predictors (here, 5)\n\\(p\\) = Outcome prevalence (here, 0.10 which is a prevalence of 10% ie. if 10 people in your sample of 100 people have HIV, the prevalence of HIV in your sample is 10%)\n\nPlugging in these values:\n\\[\nn=10×50.10=50\n\\] \\[\nn = \\frac{10 \\times 5}{0.10} = 500\n\\] \\[\nn=0.1010×5​=500\n\\]\nThis calculation suggests you would need approximately 500 participants to expect around 50 HIV-positive cases—meeting the 10 events per predictor guideline.\n\nReference:\nPeduzzi, P., Concato, J., Kemper, E., Holford, T.R., & Feinstein, A.R.

    "text": "We often want to estimate the prevalence in a population (i.e., the proportion of individuals with a certain condition). For example, if we want to estimate the prevalence of a rare disease in a population, we need to determine how many individuals we need to sample to obtain a reliable estimate.\nThe required sample size is largely influenced by how precise we want our estimate. The more accurate we want our estimate to be, the more individuals we need to sample. We report precision as how wide the 95% confidence interval will be from our prevalence estimate. If the precision is 0.05, (5%), the confidence interval will be 5% above and below the prevalence estimate. For instance, for a disease with 50% prevalence, and a precision of 5%, we need a sample size of ~ 385. Our estimated prevalence will be 50% (95% CI 45% to 55%).\nThe required sample size for estimating a proportion (prevalence) is given by:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{z^2 \\; p \\; (1-p)}{d^2}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(p\\) is the anticipated prevalence,\n\\(d\\) is the desired margin of error,\n\\(z\\) is the z-score corresponding to a confidence level of \\((1-\\alpha/2)\\) for a significance level \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nThe estimated 95% confidence interval for evenly distributed (CI) is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{CI} = p \\pm z \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\n\\]\nWhen a disease is rare, this formula does not work well as the sample size recommende becomes to small. For instance, collecting info on n=50 patients with an expected prevalence of 1% means we may not find any patients with this rare disease. The calculator therefore uses an iterative approach to find the sample size required to achieve the desired margin of error when a prevalence is less than 10%.\nThe Copper-Pearson approximation for a confidence interval is used for rare diseases:\n\\[\n\\text{CI} = \\left( \\frac{x}{n} - \\frac{z^2}{2n^2}, \\frac{x}{n} + \\frac{z^2}{2n^2} \\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(x\\) is the number of observed events.\nThis formula is repeated for differnt smaple sizes until the desired precision is achieved.\nDesirable Prevalence and Precision Estimates:\nA good starting point for a new researcher is to use prevalence estimates based on previous studies or pilot data. For instance, if studying a rare condition, a prevalence of around 1% (i.e., \\(p = 0.01\\)) might be expected, while more common conditions may have prevalences closer to 10% or even 50%.\nThe margin of error, \\(d\\), reflects how precise you want your prevalence estimate to be. A margin of error of ±5% (i.e., \\(d = 0.05\\)) is common when a high degree of precision is needed. However, if resources are limited, a wider margin (e.g., ±10% or \\(d = 0.10\\)) may be acceptable.\nKeep in mind: - Effect of Prevalence on Sample Size: The required sample size is largest when \\(p = 0.5\\) (i.e., 50%), because \\(p(1-p)\\) is maximized at this value. If the anticipated prevalence is lower or higher than 50%, the sample size required for the same margin of error decreases. - Effect of Precision on Sample Size: A smaller margin of error (i.e., a more precise estimate) increases the required sample size. Conversely, if you are willing to accept a larger margin of error, the sample size can be reduced.\n\nPractical Tip:\nWhen searching through literature, pay particular attention to the methods of data collection int he study. A study that reports a low prevalence may used very broad measures, if you are sampling from a population that has been screened or referred, your prevalence may be higher than the general population.

    "text": "Diagnostics studies are relatively simple to conduct but require careful planning and data collection. It is important to identify gold standard test and diagnostic criteria you are going to use (usually some sort of standard of care) and an experimental test you are going to study. You must have an idea of the prevalence of the disease you are studying and the estimated sensitivity and specificity of the experimental diagnostics. Sometimes, we want to correlate two diagnostic measures that are not binary, like Cd4 and Viral load. This is a different type of analysis and we will cover this in a future post. There is also finding a threshold of a continuous diagnostic, perhaps a viral load, that is most predictive of a binary outcome, like death. This is also a different type of analysis and we will cover this in a future post.\nIt is crucial to include enough subjects in both the diseased and non-diseased groups. Two key performance measures are sensitivity (the test’s ability to correctly identify those with the disease) and specificity (the test’s ability to correctly identify those without the disease).\nTo estimate either sensitivity or specificity with a desired level of precision, you can use the standard formula for proportions:\n\\[\nn=z^2×p(1−p)d^2\n\\]\n\\[\nn = \\frac{z^2 \\times p(1-p)}{d^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nn=d^2z^2×p(1−p)​\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(n\\) is the required sample size within the subgroup (diseased or non-diseased),\n\\(z\\) is the critical value corresponding to your desired confidence level (for a 95% confidence interval, \\(z≈1.96z\\))\n\\(p\\) is the expected sensitivity (or specificity), and\n\\(d\\) is the desired margin of error (half-width of the confidence interval).\n\nPractical Example:\nSuppose you expect your diagnostic test to have a sensitivity of 90% (0.90) and you desire a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of ±5% (0.05). The required number of diseased subjects is:\n\\[\nn_{\\text{disease}} =(1.96)^2×0.90(1−0.90)(0.05)^2≈139\n\\] \\[\nn_{\\text{disease}} = \\frac{(1.96)^2 \\times 0.90(1-0.90)}{(0.05)^2} \\approx 139\n\\] \\[\nn_{\\text{disease}} =(0.05)^2(1.96)^2×0.90(1−0.90)​≈139\n\\]\nSimilarly, if you expect a specificity of 90%, you would also need approximately 139 non-diseased subjects to achieve the same precision.\nIf the prevalence of the disease in your study population is known, you can determine the overall total sample size required. For example, if the disease prevalence is 10% (0.10), then to obtain about 139 diseased subjects you would need approximately:\nTotal sample size (for disease)=1390.10≈1390 = 1390Total sample size (for disease)=0.10139​≈1390\nLikewise, you can calculate the total number needed to yield the required number of non-diseased subjects.\n\nReference:\nBuderer, N. M. F. (1996). Statistical methodology: I. Incorporating the prevalence of disease into the sample size calculation for sensitivity and specificity.

    "text": "Intention\nAs a participant and epidemiologist myself, I was interested in a new analysis challenge. This is one of those things of when you are chatting in the car on the way back from Stage 7 saying, “flip, I wonder how many guys got chicked on that stage”, “who had the most consistent race”, and instead of just forgetting about it, I took it a bit further. While some of these questions are answered just by assuming what happened to the top teams on TV, I also wanted to place us mere-mortals into context. As a participant myself, these are some of the questions I had.\nIn summary, I wanted to know: - the “real” mortality rate of riders - the average time of categories - A tool to track your position over the stages compared to another team. - How well does prologue time predict overall performance? - The number of riders per capita from each country.\nWhile other, more in depth, analyses are possible, I am limited by the data available online and my real job."
