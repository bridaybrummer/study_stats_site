## Rates

Science is flexible, complex and nuanced; all projects have intricacies and it is difficult to charge a flat rate per service. Until a tiered package service is created, an hourly rate of **600 ZAR** is charged. This rate is valid until the end of February 2024. Certain services and expected time spent on each is tabulated below.
