We can step into a project at any time, it is usally ideal to touch base with us when you are developing your research question. See our blog article on [how to develop a research question](https://bridaybrummer.github.io/study_stats_site/how_it_works.html) for some key concepts to keep in mind when developing your research question, setting your objectives and calculating your sample size.

We have some tools to assist you with calculating basic sample sizes and this can help you see whether your research question is feasible with the data you have available or the data you may have to collect.\

If you don't feel like reading you can book a consultation with Brian who you can [contact on Whatsapp or e-mail](https://bridaybrummer.github.io/study_stats_site/contact.html). A 30 minute consultation is R 300.

Once you have a protocol finalised, which includes a sample size calculation and ethical approval we can provide you with a quote for completing the project, these can range from R3000 to R8000 depedning on analysis complexity). We begin work with a 50% deposit, and allow two months for the project to be revised. Revisions are charged on a case-by-case basis.

Once we receive data we try provide a rough preliminary analysis within 1-2 weeks. This gets sent as an .html file as some tables can be large and poorly formatted. We usually receive some first impressions and simple feedback on the overall analysis and then revise it to a second draft. There may be some smaller updates here and then we publish it to a word document. We may get more revisions here, such as labelling, captions etc.

The final product can be a table that you can copy paste into your manuscript.

We are not experts in copy editing and we recommend a service in [friends of StudyStats](https://bridaybrummer.github.io/study_stats_site/friends.html) for this. We can assist you in some interpretation of your tables and certain writing idiosyncracies. Check our blog for articles on interpretation and writing. In addition, [this journal article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6600813/) is a great summary on academic writing and statistics interpretation in the health sciences.
