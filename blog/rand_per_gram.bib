  abstract = {A variety of dietary choices are marketed to enhance glycogen recovery after physical activity. Past research informs recommendations regarding the timing, dose, and nutrient compositions to facilitate glycogen recovery. This study examined the effects of isoenergetic sport supplements (SS) vs. fast food (FF) on glycogen recovery and exercise performance. Eleven males completed two experimental trials in a randomized, counterbalanced order. Each trial included a 90-min glycogen depletion ride followed by a 4-hr recovery period. Absolute amounts of macronutrients (1.54 {\textpm} 0.27 g{$\cdot$}kg               -1               carbohydrate, 0.24 {\textpm} 0.04 g{$\cdot$}kg fat               -1               , and 0.18 {\textpm} 0.03g{$\cdot$}kg protein               -1               ) as either SS or FF were provided at 0 and 2 hr. Muscle biopsies were collected from the vastus lateralis at 0 and 4 hr post exercise. Blood samples were analyzed at 0, 30, 60, 120, 150, 180, and 240 min post exercise for insulin and glucose, with blood lipids analyzed at 0 and 240 min. A 20k time-trial (TT) was completed following the final muscle biopsy. There were no differences in the blood glucose and insulin responses. Similarly, rates of glycogen recovery were not different across the diets (6.9 {\textpm} 1.7 and 7.9 {\textpm} 2.4 mmol{$\cdot$}kg wet weight               - 1               {$\cdot$}hr               -1               for SS and FF, respectively). There was also no difference across the diets for TT performance (34.1 {\textpm} 1.8 and 34.3 {\textpm} 1.7 min for SS and FF, respectively. These data indicate that short-term food options to initiate glycogen resynthesis can include dietary options not typically marketed as sports nutrition products such as fast food menu items.},

  abstract = {Purpose Research has elucidated the impact of post-exercise carbohydrate nutrition and environmental conditions on muscle glycogen re-synthesis. However, research has minimally considered the implications of glycogen recovery in females and has mostly focused on commercial sport nutrition products. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of varied mixed macronutrient feedings on glycogen recovery and subsequent exercise performance in both sexes. Methods Males (n = 8) and females (n = 8) participated in a crossover study. Subjects completed a 90-min cycling glycogen depletion trial, then rested for 4 h. Two carbohydrate feedings (1.6 g kg-1) of either sport supplements or potato-based products were delivered at 0 and 2 h post-exercise. Muscle biopsies (glycogen) and blood samples (glucose, insulin) were collected during the recovery. Afterwards, subjects completed a 20 km cycling time trial. Results There was no difference between sexes or trials for glycogen recovery rates (male: 7.9 {\textpm} 2.7, female: 8.2 {\textpm} 2.7, potato-based: 8.0 {\textpm} 2.5, sport supplement: 8.1 {\textpm} 3.1 mM kg wet wt-1 h-1, p {$>$} 0.05). Time trial performance was not different between diets (38.3 {\textpm} 4.4 and 37.8 {\textpm} 3.9 min for potato and sport supplement, respectively, p {$>$} 0.05). Conclusions These results indicate that food items, such as potato-based products, can be as effective as commercially marketed sports supplements when developing glycogen recovery oriented menus and that absolute carbohydrate dose feedings (g kg-1) can be effectively applied to both males and females.},

Sports Exerc., Vol. 42, No. 11, pp. 2030--2037, 2010. The ingestion of CHO solutions has been shown to increase CHO oxidation and improve endurance performance. However, most studies have investigated CHO in solution, and sporting practice includes ingestion of CHO in solid (e.g., energy bars) as well as in liquid form. It remains unknown whether CHO in solid form is as effectively oxidized as CHO in solution. Purpose: To investigate exogenous CHO oxidation from CHO provided in either solid (BAR) or solution (DRINK) form during cycling. Methods: Eight well-trained subjects (age = 31 T 7 yr, mass = 73 T 5 kg, height = 1.79 T 0.05 m, V˙ O2max = 69 T 6 mLIkgj1Iminj1) cycled at 58\% T 4\% V˙ O2max for 180 min while receiving one of the following three treatments in randomized order: BAR plus water, DRINK, or water. The BAR and DRINK was delivered glucose + fructose (GLU + FRC) in a ratio of 2:1 at a rate of 1.55 gIminj1, and fluid intake was matched between treatments. Results: During the final 2 h of exercise, overall mean exogenous CHO oxidation rate was j0.11 gIminj1 lower in BAR (95\% confidence interval = j0.27 to 0.05 gIminj1, P = 0.19) relative to DRINK, whereas exogenous CHO oxidation rates were 15\% lower in BAR (P G 0.05) at 120, 135, and 150 min of exercise. Peak exogenous CHO oxidation rates were high in both conditions (BAR 1.25 T 0.15 gIminj1 and DRINK 1.34 T 0.27 gIminj1) but were not significantly different (P = 0.36) between treatments (mean difference = j0.9 gIminj1, 95\% confidence interval = j0.32 to 0.13 gIminj1). Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that a GLU + FRC mix administered as a solid BAR during cycling can lead to high mean and peak exogenous CHO oxidation rates (91 gIminj1). The GLU + FRC mix ingested in the form of a solid BAR resulted in similar mean and peak exogenous CHO oxidation rates and showed similar oxidation efficiencies as a DRINK. These findings suggest that CHO from a solid BAR is effectively oxidized during exercise and can be a practical form of supplementation alongside other forms of CHO.},

  abstract = {Peak exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates typically reach {\textasciitilde}1 g{$\cdot$}min-1 during exercise when ample glucose or glucose polymers are ingested. Fructose co-ingestion has been shown to further increase exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of fructose co-ingestion provided either as a monosaccharide or as part of the disaccharide sucrose on exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates during prolonged exercise in trained cyclists. Ten trained male cyclists (VO2peak: 65 {\textpm} 2 mL{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}min-1) cycled on four different occasions for 180 min at 50\% Wmax during which they consumed a carbohydrate solution providing 1.8 g{$\cdot$}min-1 of glucose (GLU), 1.2 g{$\cdot$}min-1 glucose + 0.6 g{$\cdot$}min-1 fructose (GLU + FRU), 0.6 g{$\cdot$}min-1 glucose + 1.2 g{$\cdot$}min-1 sucrose (GLU + SUC), or water (WAT). Peak exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates did not differ between GLU + FRU and GLU + SUC (1.40 {\textpm} 0.06 vs. 1.29 {\textpm} 0.07 g{$\cdot$}min-1, respectively, p = 0.999), but were 46\% {\textpm} 8\% higher when compared to GLU (0.96 {\textpm} 0.06 g{$\cdot$}min-1: p {$<$} 0.05). In line, exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates during the latter 120 min of exercise were 46\% {\textpm} 8\% higher in GLU + FRU or GLU + SUC compared with GLU (1.19 {\textpm} 0.12, 1.13 {\textpm} 0.21, and 0.82 {\textpm} 0.16 g{$\cdot$}min-1, respectively, p {$<$} 0.05). We conclude that fructose co-ingestion (0.6 g{$\cdot$}min-1) with glucose (1.2 g{$\cdot$}min-1) provided either as a monosaccharide or as sucrose strongly increases exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates during prolonged exercise in trained cyclists.},
