# Introduction

In biostatistics, understanding the underlying distribution of your data is essential. Data that follows a **normal distribution** has different characteristics compared to data that is **non-normal**. In many cases, transformations such as the **log** or **square root** can help meet the assumptions of statistical tests and improve data interpretation.

In this post, we'll explore: - **Normal distributions** and their properties - **Non-normal distributions** and why they matter - How **log** and **square root transformations** can help

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Normal Distributions

A normal distribution, often called a **Gaussian distribution**, is symmetric around its mean. Its bell-shaped curve is defined by the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ). Many statistical methods assume normality because of its well-understood properties.

*Key features of a normal distribution:* - Symmetry about the mean - Mean, median, and mode coincide - Defined by two parameters (mean and standard deviation)

*Example:*\
Many biological measurements (like blood pressure in a healthy population) are assumed to follow a normal distribution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Non-Normal Distributions

Not all data in biostatistics follow a normal distribution. Skewed data, for example, may be **right-skewed** or **left-skewed**. Non-normal data can occur due to natural biological variability or due to the measurement process itself.

*Common examples include:* - **Right-skewed data:** Enzyme levels, income data, or time-to-event data\
- **Left-skewed data:** Certain bounded measurements where many values cluster near an upper limit

When data are non-normal, the usual statistical tests that assume normality might not be valid, which is why transformations are often applied.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Log Transformation

A **log transformation** is frequently used when data are right-skewed. By taking the logarithm of the data, extreme values are compressed, which often results in a distribution that is closer to normal.

*Benefits:* - Stabilizes the variance - Makes the data more symmetric - Facilitates the use of parametric statistical tests

*When to use:*\
If your data ranges over several orders of magnitude (e.g., hormone concentrations or viral load), a log transformation can be very effective.

*Example code in R:*

``` r

# Original data vector 
data <- c(1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000) 
# Log-transformed data 
log_data <- log(data) 

print(log_data)
```
